# Rustainer Roadmap and Feature Plan

This document outlines the current status, planned features, and implementation roadmap for Rustainer, a lightweight container management UI built in Rust, inspired by Portainer and Dockge.

## Current Status

Rustainer currently implements these core features:
- Container management (view, create, start, stop, restart)
- Volume management
- Network management
- Docker Compose stack management
- User authentication
- Dark/light theme support
- Responsive design

## Architecture Overview

Rustainer is built with:
- **Backend**: Rust with Axum web framework
- **Frontend**: Server-side rendered HTML with Askama templates
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with dark/light theme support
- **Docker API**: Bollard Rust client
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLx
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens

## Feature Roadmap

The development roadmap is organized into phases, with each phase building on the previous one.

### Phase 1: Core Container Management (Completed)
- Basic container operations (CRUD, start/stop)
- Container logs and stats
- Volume and network basics
- Authentication system

### Phase 2: Docker Compose Integration (In Progress)
- Compose file parsing and validation
- Stack deployment and management
- Visual compose editor
- Stack templates

### Phase 2.5: Application & Service Routing (Planned)
- Application creation (container with service/ingress)
- Domain-based routing to applications
- Automatic service discovery
- Port 80 listener for routing traffic to containers based on domain
- Management UI remains on port 3000
- DNS integration for domain resolution
- Traffic metrics and monitoring

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Planned)
- Multi-environment support
- RBAC enhancements
- Registry integration
- Advanced networking features

### Phase 4: UI/UX Refinement (Planned)
- Modern, responsive UI
- Dark/light mode
- Real-time updates via WebSockets
- Dashboard customization

### Phase 5: Enterprise Features (Future)
- Backup and restore
- High availability
- Monitoring and alerting
- Audit logging

## Detailed Feature Plans

### 1. Authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Status**: Partially Implemented

**Remaining Work**:
- Implement role-based permissions (Admin, Operator, Viewer)
- Create user management interface for administrators
- Add user profile management

### 2. Multi-environment Support

**Status**: Planned

**Implementation Plan**:
- Create models for different environment types
- Implement connection management for remote Docker hosts
- Add support for Docker context switching
- Implement environment health checks
- Create environment management interface

### 3. Docker Compose Integration

**Status**: In Progress

**Implementation Plan**:
- Create models for Docker Compose projects
- Implement YAML parsing and validation
- Add support for compose file versions
- Create storage for compose configurations
- Implement compose up/down operations
- Add support for scaling services
- Create compose project management interface

### 4. Application Creation and Service Routing

**Status**: Planned

**Implementation Plan**:
- Create models for applications (container + service/ingress)
- Implement domain-based routing system
- Set up port 80 listener for routing traffic to containers
- Add DNS integration for domain resolution
- Implement automatic service discovery
- Create application management interface
- Add traffic metrics and monitoring
- Ensure management UI remains accessible on port 3000
- Implement SSL/TLS support for secure connections
- Add support for custom network configurations

### 5. Container Templates

**Status**: Planned

**Implementation Plan**:
- Create models for application templates
- Implement template storage and versioning
- Add support for template categories
- Implement template-based container creation
- Create template browsing interface

### 5. Advanced Networking Features

**Status**: Planned

**Implementation Plan**:
- Add support for overlay networks
- Implement macvlan and ipvlan networks
- Add support for network plugins
- Create network policy models
- Enhance network creation interface
- Implement network topology visualization

## Architecture Evolution

### Current Architecture
- Rust backend with Axum
- Server-side rendered HTML with Askama templates
- Minimal JavaScript with HTMX for dynamic updates
- Alpine.js for client-side behavior

### Previous Architecture
- Rust backend with Axum
- React frontend with TypeScript
- Axios for API communication

### Technical Differentiators
- WebAssembly support for client-side Rust code
- Efficient resource usage with lower memory footprint
- API-first design with well-documented endpoints
- Plugin system for extensibility

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Phase 1**: Completed
2. **Phase 2**: Q2 2025 (3 weeks)
3. **Phase 2.5**: Q2-Q3 2025 (4 weeks)
4. **Phase 3**: Q3 2025 (5 weeks)
5. **Phase 4**: Q4 2025 (2 weeks)
6. **Phase 5**: Q1 2026 (4 weeks)

## Development Approach

1. **Feature Development**:
   - Implement backend functionality first
   - Create API endpoints
   - Develop frontend components
   - Integrate and test

2. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - End-to-end tests for critical flows
   - Visual regression testing for UI

3. **Deployment Strategy**:
   - Single binary deployment
   - Docker container for easy installation
   - Docker Compose setup for development
