# üö¢ Rustainer ‚Äî A Lightweight Portainer Alternative

## üí° What is This?
Rustainer is a simple, fast, and minimal container management UI built entirely in Rust. It connects to the local Docker Engine via the Docker socket and offers a REST API and a web UI to:
- List, start, stop, and restart containers
- View container logs and detailed statistics
- Create new containers with customizable configurations
- Manage volumes with detailed information
- Advanced network management with IPAM configuration
- Deploy and manage Docker Compose stacks
- Create and use container templates for quick deployment
- Dark mode support for comfortable viewing

This is a **lightweight, local-first alternative to Portainer**, built for developers and homelabbers who want speed, control, and simplicity ‚Äî no Electron, no JS-heavy UI unless needed.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed and running
- Rust (if building from source)
- Node.js and npm (if developing the frontend)

### Quick Start with Docker Compose
The easiest way to run Rustainer is using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will build and start Rustainer, making it available at http://localhost:3000.

### Building from Source

#### Backend
```bash
# Build the Rust backend
cargo build --release
```

#### Frontend
```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the frontend
npm run build
```

#### Running the Application
```bash
# Run the backend (which will serve the frontend)
./target/release/rustainer
```

## üß∞ Development

### Backend Development
```bash
# Run the backend in development mode
cargo run
```

### Frontend Development
```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```
